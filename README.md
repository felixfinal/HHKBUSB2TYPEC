# HHKBUSB2TYPEC
Change HHKB Pro2 USB from MINI-B to TPYE C

1. I confirm that the USB Mini-B model used on the HHKB is HRS UX60-MB-5S8
2. I would like to use Molex 2171790001 as a replacement for the original USB, while minimizing any damage to the existing structure
3. Using a PCB thickness of 1.2mm, there may be a 0.2mm gap that needs to be adjusted using tape

The current project is in testing phase, and I have already produced the PCB and purchased the materials.
